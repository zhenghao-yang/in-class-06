					<h1>MY FAVORITE GUNDAM MOBILE SUITS TOP 3</h1>

					<h2><p>Gundam series, also known as the Gundam Series (ガンダムシリーズ Gandamu Shirīzu), is a science fiction media franchise created by Sunrise that features giant robots (mecha) with mobile suits bearing the name Gundam. It began on April 7, 1979 as Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the real robot or "mecha" anime genre by featuring giant robots in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, OVAs, films, manga, novels and video games. </p></h2>

					<h2><p>Talking about the series may seem to be an old-school interest(my father had watched the TV animate when he was at college), but those mobile suits definitely look dope! Here below are my top 3 favorites.</p></h2><br><br>

							<p>The <b>ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex</b> (ガンダムバルバトスルプスレクス) is the main mobile suit featured in the second half of Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS second season. It is piloted by Mikazuki Augus.</p>

							<p>The Gundam Barbatos Lupus fought a fierce battle against the Hashmal in the vicinity of Chryse, a city on Mars and was so severely damaged that it was sent to the Saisei's MS workshop for a major upgrade. Data sampling of Barbatos Lupus’ fight with Hashmal was also conducted during the overhaul. To match the combat data of Mikazuki Augus, who was increasing his compatibility with the mobile suit through the Alaya-Vijnana System, the machine's response speed was increased to the limit of its theoretical value. Movement of the frame's joints were also delicately tuned to match the pilot's actual sensations. The suit's cockpit hatch was changed from its predecessors' top opening method to a front opening style in consideration of Mikazuki's worsened disabilities.</p>

							<p>To more intuitively reflect Mikazuki's fighting style, the suit's arms were enlarged and elongated like a beast, and various weapons are fitted on the body. The arms' frame structure was also upgraded and reinforced. The tail parts of the Hashmal was transplanted to the suit's back, and through the Alaya-Vijnana System, Mikazuki controls this tail blade as if it was a limb. Overall, the Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex is customized for close combat, and its silhouette gives it a more ferocious look than its predecessors. The word 'Rex' means 'King' in latin, and this is fateful as Mikazuki is going along with Orga Itsuka, whose aspiration is to be King of Mars.</p>

							<p>The <b>XXXG-01D2 Gundam Deathscythe Hell</b> (aka Deathscythe Hell, or Gundam Zero-Two), is the upgraded version of XXXG-01D Gundam Deathscythe in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. The suit was redesigned by Hajime Katoki for the movie sequel New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. The unit is piloted by Duo Maxwell.</p>

							<p>A reconstructed and updated version of the Gundam Deathscythe that was destroyed by OZ, the Deathscythe Hell is also better adapted for space combat. Like its predecessor, the Deathscythe Hell is a mobile suit that specializes in stealth and close combat. The new active cloak armor mounted on the shoulders not only improve the suit's defense when closed, but also allow the suit to go invisible. When opened, the active cloak can enhance the Gundam's mobility. Duo Maxwell's favorite strategies is to use the Gundam's enhanced hyper jammers and its invisibility to sneak close to enemy units and catch them unaware. This tactic is usually good for taking out at least one or two enemy units, after which Duo will shut off the invisibility allowing his Gundam to be seen. The active cloak armor also serve to improve the suit's mobility, as they can function as wings when opened.</p>

							<p>Deathscythe Hell's primary weapon is a beam scythe much like its predecessor. However, the new beam scythe has been upgraded from the original by adding a second beam scythe blade and a small rocket engine on the end. The second beam scythe gives the weapon a slightly greater reach, while the rocket engine increases the power of the swing, allowing Deathscythe Hell to cut through multiple enemy units with ease. The Deathscythe Hell's secondary weapon is a Buster Shield on the left arm which can launch from said arm to be used as a projectile weapon. The shield has two large metal blades that open just before launch to reveal a beam blade emitter within. Despite its upgrades, the Deathsycthe Hell lacks options for sustained ranged attacks. Although it retains the relatively weak head-mounted vulcans, the clavical-mounted machine guns featured in its original form were removed in order to allow room for the Active cloak. This leaves the Deathscythe Hell's Buster Shield as its only truly dependable ranged attack.</p>

							<p>In combat, Duo Maxwell uses the same fighting style while piloting Deathscythe Hell as he did the original, however there is one significant difference. Duo seems in some cases less concerned about dodging enemy attacks. This is probably because Deathscythe Hell is equipped with a set of very durable active cloak armor which are strong enough to block multiple attacks from the beam cannons utilized by the Virgo mobile dolls. The Mobile Dolls also lack human reasoning, and thus are unable to properly assess the situation when set against the Deathscythe Hell and its sensor-jamming ability.</p>

							<p>The <b>GMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam</b> is the successor of the ZGMF-X10A Freedom. Appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, it is piloted by Kira Yamato.</p>

							<p>A mobile suit tuned to meet Kira Yamato's needs, Strike Freedom has Variable Phase Shift Armor and like its predecessor, Freedom, is primarily armed with powerful ranged weapons. Its armaments include head-mounted CIWS, an abdomen-mounted multi-phase beam cannon, hip-mounted railguns, combine-able beam sabers and beam rifles, DRAGOON pods controlled by the new Super DRAGOON system and beam shields. It is powered by the new Hyper-Deuterion Engine, and is also equipped with the Neutron Jammer Canceller and the Voiture Lumiere propulsion system.</p>

							</p>Strike Freedom's design focuses on mobility rather than armor strength as Kira is rarely hit, and the beam shields can overcome the defensive fragility. As a result, the armor is split into smaller pieces to improve the movement range of the joints (a similar armor-splitting system was also implemented in ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam). To compensate for exposing more of its internal parts, the suit's internal skeleton also has PS armor. When the internal skeleton phase-shift, the unit possess near human flexibility and through its glowing effect, is able to discharge excess residual energy within the body through the joints. This internal PS armor also helps to withstand the high output and Gs caused by the Hyper Deuterion engine and the new propulsion system, playing a role in increasing Strike Freedom's mobility. However, the main contributor to the MS's superior mobility are the mobile weapon wings, which can be deployed in the "High Mobility Aerial Tactics (HiMAT)" Mode to enhance the suit's mobility in the atmosphere or in space. The wings also features a variant of the "Voiture Lumiere" propulsion system, which can generate a visual effect called the "Wings of the Skies" similar to ZGMF-X42S Destiny's Wings of Light and is used as a means of high speed movement.</p>

							<p>The Strike Freedom's Super DRAGOON system is based on the second generation DRAGOON system deployed by ZAFT, and with unique modifications added on by Terminal. Designed for Kira's use, they allow him to hit more targets at once using the Multi Lock-On System as compared to when he was piloting the original Freedom. They also grant Kira the ability to hit the enemy from multiple directions remotely.</p><br><br>
